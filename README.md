## About
Constellations - Exploring Artistsâ€™ Networks
Constellations visualizes the relationships between contemporary artists working in various fields, creating an inside view into the networks of selected artists presented on visitmytent. Different vectors connect individuals depending on the manner of their relation. The depth of their relationship influences their proximity in the network. Selecting a specific artist points out connected artists as well as the related interview and studio visit.

The visualization was developed as a collaboration between [Stephanie Neumann](https://stephanieneumann.com/) and [Alsino Skowronnek](https://alsino.io) in Berlin, 2019.
